Brigade Alpha
=============

Welcome to the [new Brigade website](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade).

We have a few main goals with this website:

1. Clearly explain what the Brigade is.
2. Show off the activities of the Brigades.
3. Make it easy to find a local Brigade.
4. Make it easy to join a Brigade.

Install
-------
This site is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Place it in a publicly-visible directory with a webserver that has PHP installed, such as Apache. No external libraries are required.

The data about the Brigades is from the [Code for America API](http://codeforamerica.org/api). The work on that project is happening under the [cfapi](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi) repository.
