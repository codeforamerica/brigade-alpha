    <p>Thank you for signing up to start a Brigade! We’re excited to help you organize in your community.</p>

    <p>Code for America Brigades organize through the four Ps: <b> people, plans, partnerships, and participation. </b> </p>

    <p><h3>What to do next</h3></p>

    <p>Your first step in starting a Brigade is to get your people together! This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Organizing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit">core leadership team</a></li>
        <li>Putting up a website that includes a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcodeforamerica%2Fcodeofconduct&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHLV1eOOQEJLnypprXD_lXHMlg58g">Code of Conduct</a></li>
        <li>Hosting three consistent <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ukivPQNeIH2GcJHcZ50yjzh1uQj70FlilFQcUKOH49k/edit">hack nights</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Once you've done that, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forms/d/1UIcMpqI4eGeFizGaViPC6odaGGIe59pvOtWhToA6xtY/viewform">fill out this form</a> and we'll set up some time to chat and invite you to participate as a <b> Brigade Network Member </b>. You'll be able to connect with other Brigades around the world through our various digitial channels to learn how they work and to share your experiences with them.
    </p>

    <p>Want access to funding and additional resources? Whenever you are ready you can add plans and partnerships to your Brigade and join as an Official Chapter.  This includes: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/16GO5lnwEBKMFhhvewhKiNUcvVbTw5NtunVxhmCS6vw0/edit">strategic plan</a> that maps to the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/">Code for America Principles</a></li>
        <li>Building partnerships with other community groups and local government, (<a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/10/13/want-to-take-your-brigade-to-the-next-level-develop-it/">click here</a> to read about a community partner relationship with Code for Philly, and <a href="http://code4sac.org/were-coding-for-california/">click here</a> to learn how Code for Sacramento is working with one of their local government partners.</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p>
    Once you've done that, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forms/d/1odKnV_eFA2F7gix-AQXuTUhhIYrG0R6P1QYRoXw2EL8/viewform">fill out this form</a> and we'll set up some time to chat and invite you to participate as an <b> Official Brigade Chapter</b>. I.E. You can join as an Official Brigade Chapter after you have participated as a Brigade Network Member for a while, or in one swoop by submitting to the Official Brigade Chapter form once you have completed all four Ps). 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>If you are joining from outside the United States</b>, you can participate in the Brigade network as an Brigade Network Member. If your Brigade grows, we may want to consider becoming a Code for All member, which is the support route interntaional Brigades take instead of becoming Official Brigade Chapters.
